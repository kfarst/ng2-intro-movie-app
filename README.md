# codementor.io Intro to Angular 2 Movie App

This app is used as a live demonstration during [codementor.io](https://www.codementor.io)'s Intro to Angular 2 course. The project is built upon each week to teach the concrete concepts of Angular 2 as well as the development flow of features in Angular 2 using the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15.

## Getting started
* Ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed
* Within the project, run `npm install`
* The app is built with [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), therefore an API key must be obtained
* Depending on the commit and week, search the app for `your key here` and replace it with your API key
* Run `npm start` to start the server
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
* The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files
